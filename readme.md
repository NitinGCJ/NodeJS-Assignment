# Weather App using Open-Weather API 
Basic website to get real-time weather of entered cities through API calling on NodeJS backend. 
1.Clone the repo and do npm i in the terminal to install all dependencies(express,axios etc) setup the nodejs server on your local computer
2.Open the index.html file from the vanilla/frontend folder
3.Enter the city(s) (comma separated if multiple) and hit submit, you will see the respective temperatures of the cities.
Thanks!!
